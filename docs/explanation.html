          <p> 		The Mayan Civilization is divided into three Periods by historians: The Pre-Classic Period from (1200B.C. – A.D. 250), the Classic Period from (A.D. 250 to 900 A.D.) and the Post-Classic period from (900 A.D. – 1508 A.D.) (Shoman, 2011, p.2). The Classic Period being the period where the Mayan Civilization according to Historians saw its peak and made great achievements. These great achievements were made in sectors that had appeared in the pre-Classic period such as in mathematics, astronomy, arts, architecture and writing and also the formation of a belief system (Shoman, 2011, p.2). Due to the advancements made by the Mayans, one of the most famed achievements made was the concept of the zero in mathematics. It was during this period that cities also began trading and some were able to control strategic and important trade routes which made them incredibly rich and powerful. Although they had a peak in their civilization it all came to a steady decline in the post-Classic period because of both external and internal factors, which were increase in wars, social upheaval, ecological failure, changes in trade patterns as well as the invasion of the foreigners from the west.</p>


          <p>The project has been done to be a website. Th reason for the decision in making the project into a website is because many students now a days find their research online. Books are still read but website are always being and in making the project into a website it makes a little more interesting. Using a website to explain the topic also makes it easier to follow the topic and understand.  </p> 

          <p>The first primary source is the head of a rain God which is currently held at the Met Museum in New York. The head of the rain god that had been carved from limestone was excavated in chichen itza by George Vaillant in 1926. The creators of the rain God head monument were the Mayan sculpturers of Chichen Itza. The reason for its creation is mostly believed to have been as an architectural free-standing monument. The reason for this source is that it proves that the Mayans indeed had established a belief system.  
          </p>

          <p>The second primary source is a picture of the Tikal Mayan ruin in Guatemala. The Tikal Maya ruins were created by the Mayans themselves some which served as Palaces and others as observatories and temples for the priests to practice their rituals. Most of the large temples were created and were for intended use for the elites. The source presents the architecture advancements the Mayans made in Classic period. With the picture of the ruin, it can clearly depict the level of architecture the Mayans had developed.  </p>

          <p>The third primary source is a picture of a part of the Madrid codex. The Madrid codex was created by the Mayan scribes and they were the books of the Mayans. It was mostly intended for the elites of the Mayan class. It was mostly created to record great achievements made by the king but also served to record other types of information. The source is used to convey the idea of the Mayan having created a very complex way of writing. The type of writing which is called Hieroglyphics. With the book one of only 4 that survived the Spanish conquest it serves to prove that indeed a complex and some form or writing did exist in Mayan culture.  </p>

          <p>The fourth primary source is a picture of the Dresden codex. This codex is another of the only 4 Mayan codices or Mayan books that are in known to be in existence. The Dresden codex was also created by Mayan scribes. Like the Madrid codex this was also mostly intended for the use of the elite class. The use of this source is due to Mayan having had invented the zero concept in Mathematics and their vast knowledge and interest in astronomy. Both Mathematics and astronomy have famed the Mayans and the Dresden codex server to prove that since on the pages, the numeric system that they Mayan used was written on and can be seen. </p>

          <p>The fifth source is a secondary source, being the book titled “The MAYA” seventh edition by Michael D. Coe. The intended audience for the book is more likely Mayan enthusiasts and scholars as well. Its creation being done in order to keep information accurate since it is the seventh edition and many new things about the Mayans had been discovered, so its important that books keep up to date their information. This book was used in order to back up the idea of a religious belief as well as the existence of mathematics and astronomy. </p>

          <p>The sixth source also secondary source, being a book title “The complete Illustrated history of the AZTEC AND MAYA” by Charles Phillips. The intended audience for the book are mostly scholars and those interested in the Maya and Aztecs. It’s creation was done in order to deliver information about two civilizations that existed in Mesoamerica. With this source it was able to back up the idea of Mayas and a trading system. </p>
